```

### Invoice Template Data

For the `invoice` template, each file entry should contain:

```yaml
version: "0.1"
files:
  - name: "invoice-005"
    data:
      invoice:
        number: "INV-005"
        date: "September 20, 2024"
      
      company:

        total: "4,860.00"
```

./output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ invoice-005.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invoice-006.pdf
```

## üìù Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing how to generate invoice PDFs:

1. **Create a data file** (`my-invoices.yaml`):

```yaml
version: "0.1"
files:
  - name: "monthly-invoice-001"
    data:
      invoice:
        number: "INV-2024-001"
        date: "January 15, 2024"
      
      company:
        name: "Acme Solutions LLC"
        address: "456 Enterprise Blvd"
        city: "San Francisco"
        state: "CA"
        zip: "94105"
      
      client:
        name: "Jane Smith"
        company: "TechCorp Inc."
      
      lineItems:
        - description: "Software Development"
          quantity: "40"
          rate: "$125.00"
          amount: "$5,000.00"
        - description: "Code Review & Testing"
          quantity: "8"
          rate: "$100.00"
          amount: "$800.00"
      
      totals:
        subtotal: "5,800.00"
        tax: "464.00"
        total: "6,264.00"
```

2. **Generate the PDF**:

```bash
evalcraft generate:pdf -d my-invoices.yaml -t invoice
```

3. **Check the output**:

```bash
ls ./output/
# monthly-invoice-001.pdf
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "File not found"**
- Ensure the YAML file path is correct
- Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work

**Error: "Template not found"**
- Check that you're using a supported template name
- Current options: `invoice`

**Error: "YAML parsing failed"**
- Verify your YAML syntax is correct
- Ensure proper indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
- Check that all required fields are present

**Output directory issues**
- The CLI creates the `./output/` directory automatically
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show general help
